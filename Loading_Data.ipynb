idea that many critics say is overblown and the potential republican presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants insistence on nonassimilation the fact that youve got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values which he called dangerous jindal has the reputation of policy wonk among republicans and boldly told gop officials during a address to the republican national committee that they must stop being the stupid party and needed to stop insulting the intelligence of voters asked by cnns wolf blitzer whether he would walk back his comments on nogo zones made in a speech to the henry jackson society in london earlier that day jindal said not at all msnbc guest wont apologize for jindal remark and im also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical islam is a grave threat we need muslim leaders to denounce the individuals not just the acts of violence he said adding that it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation of immigrants in the united states but pressed for specific examples of such nogo zones jindal demurred saying he had met with elected officials and others to discuss them and noted a report in uk tabloid the daily mail that purported to highlight the challenges facing law enforcement in such areas i knew by speaking the truth we were gonna make people upset jindal told blitzer jindal was also unable to offer examples during an earlier interview with cnns max foster saying that hes heard from folks here that there are neighborhoods where women dont feel comfortable going in without veils we all know that there are neighborhoods where police are less likely to go into i think that the radical left absolutely wants to pretend like this problem is not here pretending its not here wont make it go away he told foster pressed for details jindal said only i think your viewers know absolutely there are places where the police are less likely to go and asked whether that feeling may be caused by high crime rates rather than the muslim population in the area jindal said this isnt a question i know the left wants to make this into an attack on religion and thats not what this is what we are saying its absolutely an issue for the uk absolutely is an issue for america and other european and western nations he said during his london speech jindal said in the west nonassimilationist muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home according to prepared remarks it is startling to think that any country would allow even unofficially for a socalled nogo zone the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom he said jindal also suggested the rise of such nogo zones has contributed to growing antisemitism throughout europe which has prompted many jews to emigrate from their home countries how does such evil rise again in democratic countries jindal asked i believe it is because radical islamists have been given too wide a berth to establish their own nation within a nation he said muslim leaders need to condemn anyone who commits these acts of violence and clearly state that these people are evil and are enemies of islam he added the idea of nogo zones sparked controversy last week when a fox news commentator raised the prospect of areas in france britain sweden and germany where those countries governments dont exercise any sovereignty and which instead are run largely by muslim immigrants the commentator also mentioned whole cities where nonmuslims simply dont go in in particular the city of birmingham in the united kingdom british prime minister david cameron later pushed back on the idea calling the commentator a complete idiot when i heard this frankly i choked on my porridge and i thought it must be april fools day this guy is clearly a complete idiot he said the fox commentator later apologized to birmingham for labeling it a nogo zone but stood by the idea that such areas exist fox news however issued a formal apology for the remarks with host julie banderas retracting the comments as regrettable errors and saying the network deeply regrets the errors and apologizes to any and all who may have taken offense cnnmoney fox news apologizes times for inaccurate comments about muslims in europe but a jindal aide said the governor stuck largely to the text as prepared which included the criticism of the zones and the remarks have drawn praise from conservatives and attacted national media attention at a time when the potential presidential contender is looking to raise his profile in time for a white house bid national review columnist larry kudlow called it a brilliant take on radical islam it is the toughest speech i have read on the whole issue of islamic radicalism and its destructive murdering barbarous ways which are upsetting the entire world kudlow wrote in an oped democrats though knocked jindal its no surprise that bobby jindal would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people this is exactly what weve come to expect from jindal here at home democratic national committee spokeswoman rebecca chalif told cnn jindal is just embarrassing himself he is abroad while louisiana is facing a budget crisis of his own making he cant even govern his state he is the last person we want wading into foreign policy opinion

victims of crime it feels like a combination of a kind a sexual assault and stalking it is very harmful the subject of modernday peeping toms made national headlines this week when massachusetts highest court ruled that a man who snapped cell phone photos up the skirt of women on the boston subway did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude as stipulated by a state law against secretive photography the controversial decision overruled a lower court that upheld charges against michael robertson who was arrested in august after police set up a sting following reports that he was using his cell phone to take upskirt photos and videos of women without their knowledge a female passenger on a mbta massachusetts bay transportation authority trolley who is wearing a skirt dress or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is partially nude no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing wrote justice margot botsford of the state supreme judicial court in massachusetts prosecutors and state lawmakers called for a revision of the law after state house speaker robert deleo said the legislature would seek to close the loophole in the law quickly the house and state senate on thursday passed a bill making upskirting illegal with the measure going to the governor for signing armed with smartphones ipads or other hightech gadgetry peeping toms are snapping pictures of unsuspecting women in public places and sharing the images on the web keyword searches on web browsers and social media sites such as facebook and instragram turn up multiple hits for upskirting and downblousing sites displaying surreptitious images of womens private body areas theres an epidemic around street harassment broadly but also weve received tons of upskirt reports as well said emily may executive director of ihollabackorg a web site that encourages women to share their stories and cell

may never know about it knecht said some states have taken steps to deal with hightech peeping but many others have failed to update antiquated voyeurism laws that are on the books in florida for instance video voyeurism is a felony washington state changed its law to add language noting that people have an expectation of privacy in public as well as private spaces knecht said states such as kentucky mississippi new hampshire new mexico north dakota and wisconsin have not updated laws to make the distribution of such images or videos on the web a crime in congress passed a federal law making it a crime to photograph peoples private areas on federal properties including national parks and military bases or to broadcast such images but states are responsible for making hightech peeping a crime elsewhere we dont know how many incidents happen and victims dont know about it knecht said but when the cases do come i think that we need laws that cover them what we know about these cases is its not only one picture taken for somebodys personal gratification that happens sometimes but other times people are taking the pictures and putting them on the internet and theyre going even international its not just one instance of victimization its many susan gallagher a professor of political science at the university of massachusetts lowell whose specialty is gender privacy and politics said that stricter upskirting laws could make the practice more tantalizing to voyeurs its only because its creepy that people do this she said you could see obviously a lot more of womens bodies in other places upskirting doesnt really reveal much of womens bodies you could see way more on the internet if you just wanted to she added i think the only thrill is the surreptitiousness of it she doesnt know shes sort of turned into like this passive object gallagher said that snapping pictures of perpetrators and making them public is more of a deterrent thats much more effective she said the picture takers dont want to be outed youre shaming them when gallagher lived in new york city she said men exposed themselves to her on two occasions the way i got back was i didnt react she said i said oh hello as if there was nothing going on he was crestfallen he wanted me to be shocked i think the picture taking is the same sort of defense youre going against the expectations of the perpetrator but may said the hollaback site backed by activists in cities and countries is not about revenge in fact the group prefers educating harassers than penalizing them she said were really trying to bring awareness still may said there is value in the digital stories and pictures from victims whats amazing about it is your ability to turn the lens on them right when youre being harassed she said its certainly a very empowering thing</td>\n",

       "0     at the start of a big week for the higgs boson the most soughtafter particle in all of physics scientists in illinois said monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion the scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than years of research and trillion particle collisions using the us department of energys fermilab tevatron collider near batavia illinois whose budgetary woes shut it down last year what is the higgs boson and why is it important their announcement came two days before researchers at the large hadron collider under the alps are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the cern particle physics laboratory in geneva switzerland our data strongly point toward the existence of the higgs boson rob roser a spokesman for one of two independent experiments at the tevatron said in a statement but it will take results from the experiments at the large hadron collider in europe to establish a discovery read more the woman at the edge of physics finding the higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass one of the open questions in physicists current understanding of the way the universe works the particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist leon lederman reportedly wanted to call his book the goddamn particle but he truncated that epithet to the god particle which may have helped elevate the particles allure in popular culture more science news from cnn light years the results from the tevatron stemming from the two different experiments suggest that if the higgs boson does exist it would have a mass between and gev about times the mass of the proton before the tevatron closed the experiments there sent beams of particles whizzing around a fourmile circumference in opposite directions traveling at a fraction below the speed of light the particles would crash into each other creating conditions similar to those at the dawn of the universe for scientists to observe but so far neither the results from the us collider experiments nor from the the large hadron collider located feet underneath the border of france and switzerland have enough statistical significance to constitute a discovery it is easier to look for a friends face in a sports stadium filled with people than to search for a higgslike event among trillions of collisions said luciano ristori a physicist at the us facility attention now turns to the latest analysis of data from the billion european machine the worlds most powerful particle smasher we now have more than double the data we had last year sergio bertolucci the director for research and computing at cern said last month that should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the data are still there or whether theyve gone away its a very exciting time scientists getting clearer picture of god particle

       "1     george zimmerman acquitted by a florida jury over the death of trayvon martin was arrested in florida on suspicion of aggravated assault and domestic violence with a weapon local authorities said the florida resident was arrested friday by police in lake mary at about pm and booked into the john e polk correctional facility according to that facilitys website that facility like its website is run by the seminole county sheriffs office it all came about after zimmerman allegedly threw a wine bottle at a girlfriend his lawyer don west told reporters whatever happened took place several days ago said west and as far as i know they have not been together for some time certainly not since then police first learned about it after coming in contact with the alleged victim at a traffic stop on monday lake mary police spokeswoman bianca gillett said when asked about the delay in making the arrest gillett said the arresting officer tried to reach zimmerman on monday and tuesday but couldnt and was offduty wednesday and thursday it was the officers decision not to pass off the case to another officer gillett said the incident is the latest legal runin for zimmerman since his acquittal in july on a murder charge in the death of martin a africanamerican in fact its his second arrest for alleged domestic violence against a girlfriend though lake mary police spokeswoman bianca gillett said this alleged victim is not the same woman as in its clear he hasnt been very lucky with the ladies the last few months west said of his client judge bars contact orders weapons surrendered zimmerman appeared saturday morning before judge john galluzo who decided to bar him from contacting the alleged victim or going into volusia county he was also told to surrender any weapons to a relative or third party but not to stop drinking since the judge said there wasnt any allegation of abuse of alcohol in the arrest affidavit appearing in court is not new for zimmerman who became a national figure in after spotting martin in his sanford florida neighborhood the two ended up having a confrontation that climaxed with zimmerman fatally shooting the teenager who was unarmed that incident and authorities decision not to immediately charge zimmerman spurred largescale protests in april of that year zimmerman was charged with seconddegree murder with an affidavit accusing him of profiling martin and ignoring a police dispatchers request that he wait for police after a highprofile trial a jury found zimmerman not guilty that made him a free man but did not end his issues with the law no charge after other domestic violence claim about two weeks after the verdict he was pulled over for speeding in northern texas much bigger troubles came in november when zimmerman was taken into custody at his thengirlfriends apoka florida home after the two allegedly had a heated fight he was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief accusations that he denied he posted bail days later but after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped state attorney phil archer announced that prosecutors would not press charges more recently in september lake mary police said that a man claimed that zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident i will kill you zimmerman allegedly said according to police do you know who i am he was not arrested and has not been charged west said that his client who posted bail later saturday doesnt have a fulltime job implying hes had his struggles since the martin acquittal its been a devastating experience that hes had that hes working through the lawyer said im concerned obviously as we are here again this morning cnns christine

       "4     louisiana gov bobby jindal on monday stood by his criticism of socalled nogo zones in europe where sovereign nations allegedly cede authority to muslim immigrants a controversial idea that many critics say is overblown and the potential republican presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants insistence on nonassimilation the fact that youve got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values which he called dangerous jindal has the reputation of policy wonk among republicans and boldly told gop officials during a address to the republican national committee that they must stop being the stupid party and needed to stop insulting the intelligence of voters asked by cnns wolf blitzer whether he would walk back his comments on nogo zones made in a speech to the henry jackson society in london earlier that day jindal said not at all msnbc guest wont apologize for jindal remark and im also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical islam is a grave threat we need muslim leaders to denounce the individuals not just the acts of violence he said adding that it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation of immigrants in the united states but pressed for specific examples of such nogo zones jindal demurred saying he had met with elected officials and others to discuss them and noted a report in uk tabloid the daily mail that purported to highlight the challenges facing law enforcement in such areas i knew by speaking the truth we were gonna make people upset jindal told blitzer jindal was also unable to offer examples during an earlier interview with cnns max foster saying that hes heard from folks here that there are neighborhoods where women dont feel comfortable going in without veils we all know that there are neighborhoods where police are less likely to go into i think that the radical left absolutely wants to pretend like this problem is not here pretending its not here wont make it go away he told foster pressed for details jindal said only i think your viewers know absolutely there are places where the police are less likely to go and asked whether that feeling may be caused by high crime rates rather than the muslim population in the area jindal said this isnt a question i know the left wants to make this into an attack on religion and thats not what this is what we are saying its absolutely an issue for the uk absolutely is an issue for america and other european and western nations he said during his london speech jindal said in the west nonassimilationist muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home according to prepared remarks it is startling to think that any country would allow even unofficially for a socalled nogo zone the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom he said jindal also suggested the rise of such nogo zones has contributed to growing antisemitism throughout europe which has prompted many jews to emigrate from their home countries how does such evil rise again in democratic countries jindal asked i believe it is because radical islamists have been given too wide a berth to establish their own nation within a nation he said muslim leaders need to condemn anyone who commits these acts of violence and clearly state that these people are evil and are enemies of islam he added the idea of nogo zones sparked controversy last week when a fox news commentator raised the prospect of areas in france britain sweden and germany where those countries governments dont exercise any sovereignty and which instead are run largely by muslim immigrants the commentator also mentioned whole cities where nonmuslims simply dont go in in particular the city of birmingham in the united kingdom british prime minister david cameron later pushed back on the idea calling the commentator a complete idiot when i heard this frankly i choked on my porridge and i thought it must be april fools day this guy is clearly a complete idiot he said the fox commentator later apologized to birmingham for labeling it a nogo zone but stood by the idea that such areas exist fox news however

       "4996  ilse knecht has worked with victims of disturbing voyeuristic trends such as upskirting and downblousing one woman showered for years in a swimsuit after a peeping incident involving her landlord knecht said others stopped wearing skirts entirely victims say people dont understand the impact of this crime said knecht a policy expert at the washingtonbased national center for victims of crime it feels like a combination of a kind a sexual assault and stalking it is very harmful the subject of modernday peeping toms made national headlines this week when massachusetts highest court ruled that a man who snapped cell phone photos up the skirt of women on the boston subway did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude as stipulated by a state law against secretive photography the controversial decision overruled a lower court that upheld charges against michael robertson who was arrested in august after police set up a sting following reports that he was using his cell phone to take upskirt photos and videos of women without their knowledge a female passenger on a mbta massachusetts bay transportation authority trolley who is wearing a skirt dress or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is partially nude no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing wrote justice margot botsford of the state supreme judicial court in massachusetts prosecutors and state lawmakers called for a revision of the law after state house speaker robert deleo said the legislature would seek to close the loophole in the law quickly the house and state senate on thursday passed a bill making upskirting illegal with the measure going to the governor for signing armed with smartphones ipads or other hightech gadgetry peeping toms are snapping pictures of unsuspecting women in public places and sharing the images on the web keyword searches on web browsers and social media sites such as facebook and instragram turn up multiple hits for upskirting and downblousing sites displaying surreptitious images of womens private body areas theres an epidemic around street harassment broadly but also weve received tons of upskirt reports as well said emily may executive director of ihollabackorg a web site that encourages women to share their stories and cell phone photographs of harassers and peeping toms i think theres a fear among people that you could have an upskirt photo taken of you and never realize it your crotch could be on the internet and you may never know about it knecht said some states have taken steps to deal with hightech peeping but many others have failed to update antiquated voyeurism laws that are on the books in florida for instance video voyeurism is a felony washington state changed its law to add language noting that people have an expectation of privacy in public as well as private spaces knecht said states such as kentucky mississippi new hampshire new mexico north dakota and wisconsin have not updated laws to make the distribution of such images or videos on the web a crime in congress passed a federal law making it a crime to photograph peoples private areas on federal properties including national parks and military bases or to broadcast such images but states are responsible for making hightech peeping a crime elsewhere we dont know how many incidents happen and victims dont know about it knecht said but when the cases do come i think that we need laws that cover them what we know about these cases is its not only one picture taken for somebodys personal gratification that happens sometimes but other times people are taking the pictures and putting them on the internet and theyre going even international its not just one instance of victimization its many susan gallagher a professor of political science at the university of massachusetts lowell whose specialty is gender privacy and politics said that stricter upskirting laws could make the practice more tantalizing to voyeurs its only because its creepy that people do this she said you could see obviously a lot more of womens bodies in other places upskirting doesnt really reveal much of womens bodies you could see way more on the internet if you just wanted to she added i think the only thrill is the surreptitiousness of it she doesnt know shes sort of turned into like this passive object gallagher said that snapping pictures of perpetrators and making them public is more of a deterrent thats much more effective she said the picture takers dont want to be outed youre shaming them when gallagher lived in new york city she said men exposed themselves to her on two occasions the way i got back was i didnt react she said i said oh hello as if there was nothing going on he was crestfallen he wanted me to be shocked i think the picture taking is the same sort of defense youre going against the expectations of the perpetrator but may said the hollaback site backed by activists in cities and countries is not about revenge in fact the group prefers educating harassers than penalizing them she said were really trying to bring awareness still may said there is value in the digital stories and pictures from victims whats amazing about it is your ability to turn the lens on them right when youre being harassed she said its certainly a very empowering thing

       "4997  some foods sold in supermarkets across america contain tiny engineered particles called nanomaterials our organization decided to test doughnuts after learning that the titanium dioxide used as a coloring in the powdered sugar coating likely contained nanosized particles the tests conducted by an independent laboratory found that both dunkin donuts powdered cake donuts and hostess donettes did indeed contain titanium dioxide nanoparticles in response a spokeswoman for dunkin donuts said the company was looking into the matter you must be wondering what are nanomaterials they are microscopic in size if a nanoparticle were the size of a football a red blood cell would be the size of the field nanoparticles have been heralded as having the potential to revolutionize the food industry from enabling the production of creamy liquids that contain no fat to enhancing flavors improving supplement delivery providing brighter colors keeping food fresh longer or indicating when it spoils but there are a few problems one is that no one knows how many and which food products have them companies are not being forthcoming about whether they are using nanoparticles to further complicate the issue some companies may not even be aware that they are selling products containing them many companies are reluctant or uninterested in discussing the issue and concrete information has been difficult to obtain the majority of food companies are not responsive in providing information about their specific uses plans and policies toward nanoparticles there is also no law in the united states that requires disclosure in contrast companies in the european union are required to label foods containing nanoparticles the bigger issue with nanoparticles is that they might pose health risks as they have been found to in tests on mice there are not nearly enough studies that can adequately demonstrate the safety of nanoparticles in food additives or packaging scientists are still investigating how the broad range of nanoparticles with their myriad potential uses would react in the body when ingested nanosized particles can pass into the blood and lymph where they circulate through the body and reach in potentially sensitive sites such as bone marrow lymph nodes the spleen the brain the liver and the heart our knowledge about how nanomaterial food additives react in the body and their health impact is still in its infancy while efforts are under way to understand them better much deeper scientific inquiry should occur before nanoparticles are sold in food and foodrelated products more companies and consumers need to be aware of the use of engineered nanomaterials in foods and the potential unknown risks of this technology more food products like mms and poptarts should be tested as recent studies have identified them as likely to contain nanomaterials as well fortunately a few companies have become willing to take a public position on nanoparticles mcdonald stated that it does not currently support the use by suppliers of nanoengineered materials in the production of any of our food packaging and toys similarly kraft foods said that it was not using nanotechnology some of the largest food companies in the world including yum brands pepsico and whole foods need to know more about nanomaterials and check with their supplies to see if they are using them americans are becoming increasingly interested in what is in the food theyre eating no longer content with label information on daily allowances of vitamins and minerals us consumers are following the lead of their counterparts in many other countries by demanding more disclosure about where and how their food is grown and whether it is safe even though communicating risks to consumers can be challenging the publics perception of safety will be paramount in determining the acceptance of nanomaterials this is especially true for an emerging foodproducts technology

       "4998  a year after isis became a household name in america using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents us prosecutions of wouldbe recruits have exploded the flurry of arrests at least people have been detained since january is a sign that complicated manpowerintensive investigations begun when isis started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed but they also highlight the unique challenges that isis poses in comparison with al qaeda which has attracted fewer usbased recruits like a new rock band storming the music charts isis has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda law enforcement officials said the group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers at first most of the recruits were selfstarters people radicalized on their own from consuming isis propaganda from youtube videos and other social media much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailerstyle videos some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who isis leaders decide doesnt comport with their medieval brand of islam but once those initial western recruits arrived living in the selfdeclared isis caliphate spanning parts of syria and iraq they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them in minnesota nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to american abdi nur who turned up fighting with isis in syria in and began to appeal to his friends to come to the middle east each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here a senior us counterterrorism official said its a phenomenon observed in norway and other european nations where clusters of young people have been lured to isis and the isis recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al qaeda has had a decade ago that groups recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hardtoreach areas of afghanistan and pakistans tribal region few westerners went through the trouble minneapolis men allegedly trying to join isis highlight role of american recruiter today isis occupies much more accessible territory mostly reachable through turkey istanbuls airport has easy connections to western europe and much of the rest of the world from there turkeys modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to syria the informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward its harder for us to pick up on the us counterterrorism official said of the peertopeer recruitment which is well below the radar how isis is luring westerners before isis investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks al qaeda recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect islamic holy lands much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative islamic histories including saudi arabia and yemen us officials said in contrast isis takes a somewhat secular approach portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt west and people attracted to isis marketing run the gamut from rich to poor educated to dropout male to female teenaged to middleaged there are signs western recruits have risen to high levels in the isis organization with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda counterterrorism and intelligence officials said the english is proper with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes and while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are
